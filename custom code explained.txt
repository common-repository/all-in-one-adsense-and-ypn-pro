= How do I put a little space between content and ads? =

Many people have asked me about this, so I am putting the solution in this file separately.

You could achieve this by using the code before and code after fields in the options. For example, to add 5px of blank space between your content and ads, you could put 

Code before the ad: <div style="padding:5px;"> 

Code after the ad: </div>

These settings are in the plugin options menu. "Options->Adsense"
